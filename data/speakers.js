      steps to compile, transpile, tree-shake(?!), inline, and more are becoming increasingly
      common - primarily due to the rapidly expanding scale at which people use modules and packages
      in their JavaScript. In this talk, I'll discuss my experience learning the Rust programming
      language and writing an operating system, IntermezzOS, and what it taught me about these
      useful, yet intimidating, frontend JavaScript workflows. We'll take a close look at the
      "abstraction tax" that we all pay in spades, and discuss the methods by which tools can help
